/*
*
* Output Explanation:

* Traditional Thread Pool:
* Only 3 threads (pool-1-thread-1, pool-1-thread-2, pool-1-thread-3) are created. The system reuses the same threads to handle 5 orders.
* If you had thousands of tasks, you would need a large thread pool or efficient thread reuse, both of which add complexity.

* Virtual Threads:
* Each task (order) gets its own virtual thread (VirtualThread[#n]), even though only 5 tasks are created. Virtual threads are lightweight, so we donâ€™t need to limit the number of concurrent threads.
* With virtual threads, even thousands or millions of concurrent tasks can be handled efficiently without adding resource overhead.
